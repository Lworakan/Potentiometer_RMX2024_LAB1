# Potentiometer_RMX2024_LAB1 - Magnetic Field and Voltage Response Experiment

## Overview

This repository contains the data, results, and analysis of the experiment focused on the behavior and working principles of the Ratiometric Linear Hall Effect Magnetic Sensor. The primary goal of the lab was to:

- Analyze the relationship between magnetic flux density and distance.
- Study how magnetic field strength affects RMS voltage output.
- Explore the effects of shielding on the magnetic field.

## Experiment Setup

The experiment setup includes:
1. **Hall Effect Sensor**: Measures the magnetic field strength.
2. **Potentiometer**: Adjusts the input signal.
3. **Magnetic Shields**: To observe the shielding effect on magnetic field strength and its impact on voltage output.
4. **Webcam rapoo c260**: Captures the setup and measurements for real-time monitoring.
5. **Simulink and MATLAB**: Used for data logging and analysis of the signals.

## Objectives

1. Measure the RMS voltage output as a function of distance from the magnet.
2. Determine how the magnetic field strength correlates to RMS voltage output.
3. Compare results with and without magnetic shielding.
